# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering,

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the process of designing, building,testing and maintaining software applications
Importance of software engineering is as follows;less expensive than hard engineering options
Develop reliable, efficient, and scalable software solutionsto meet the needs of users and businesses effectively
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Static type
practical type
embedded type


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.planning and Requirement ANALYSIS.The information ffrom this analysis forms the building blocks of a basic project. ie planning. define project scope,setting of objectives and resource planning
2. Defining requirements
3. Designing architecture
4.Developing product
5. Product testing and integration
6.Deployment and Mainteneance of products


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before next while agile is iterative, flexible that emphasizes collaboration, continous feedback and adapting changes throughout the stages of project lifescycle
waterfall is difficult and costly while agile is easy and cheaper

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPER writing of code, testing and debugging and designing software
QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER ensures product quality by designing and executing tests, identifying defects and collaborating with development teams to improve softwareor products before release. 
PROJECT MANAGER organize software projects and can assign tasks to software engineering team according to specification of task
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs Helps programmers deveop sofware code efficienntly
 VCS enable efficient tracking and manangement of code changes, facilitating collaboration, ensuring code quality and allowingfor easy rollback to previous versions, streamlining the development process

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Rapid evolving technologies
2.  management of complex projects
3.  balancing quality with  deadlines
4.  ensuring security and scalability
SOLUTIONS
1. keeping up with technology
2. design patterns, code reviews, debugging tools, refactoring
3. continous learning, experimentation, community engagement
4. agile methodologies, version control
5. prioritization, time estimation

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing is a software testing where individual compononents or modules are tested in isolation to ensure they function correctly
intergration testing tests how different modules or components work together as whole
system testing exams every component of application to make sure they workas complete and together as whole
Acceptance testing is a quality assurance processthat verifies whether softwareproduct or system meets end user or businness requirement
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 prompt engineering is the process of designing instructions for AI models to produce desired output
importance of prompt engineering helps AI models understand user intentions and  generate relevant responces
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
